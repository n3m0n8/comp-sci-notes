CIA Triad: Confidentiality ||   Integrity  ||  Availability ||

Confidentiality:

- Encryption
Data  is encrypted through cryptographic hashes (ISAAC and Mersenne Twister for
instance) as well as an algorithm that encrypts the hashed password several times
(cycles). These include AES and others.

- Access Controls
Control over user access is a brute but efficient manner to avoid data breaches.
This can be done via tripartite verification method of the correct identiy and
access level of the user. This is: 1) Identification - using a login or id, 2)
authentication (using a password or biometric data), 3) Authorization (granting or
withdrawing the access of certain data or directories/files to the relevant user)


- Integrity
Integrity ensures that data has not been altered or modified/corrupted. Only
authorized users should be able to access and modify data.
This is done via 1) Hashing - for instance in using an MD5, SHA-1 or HMAC Hash to
ensure the data's integrity.
2) Another option is the use of digital signatures or certificates.
   - Digital signatures provide authentication but also conveniently provide non-
   repudiation meaning that the sender and reciever are obliged to acknowledge the
   sending of the data as well as validating its confidentiality.
      - blockchain technology is a type of digital signing.
   - Digital signatures can require the use of a certificate and can use a Public
   Key Infrastructure which can allow for the exchange and verification of private
   keys via a public key middleman.

- Availability
  This element is required to ensure that data is available as and when required
  It covers aspects relating to the potential for data loss, data transfer faults
  or interruptions and also making sure that data is not made impossible to access
  by the first two letters of the CIA triad - confidentiality and integrity.
    - Data loss can be protected against via backups, multi-site physical or virtualised
    redundancies (on-site or online servers, backup servers) and in the most critical
    cases, using backup power supplies, cooling systems to ensure devices are maintained
    optimally.
    -Ensuring data transfer - This is done via both positive and negative elements.
    Positive elements would ensure a lack of slow down in network traffic via such
    approaches as load balancing, torrenting or mesh networking- this allows for
    redundancies and spreading out the data load over multiple servers and networks.
    In terms of negative approaches, this is done by pre-empting and defending against
    potential Malware or DDOS attacks that seek to affect the network and servers'
    capacities.

One issue that arises is how to ensure the identity verification process in the
initial stage. There are several ways to ensure this:

1. The easiest way to do this is via a proof of id request - done either physical
as is the case with new hires introduced to an IT worker by HR, or via a Digital
upload of an ID document (passport, driving license etc).

2.Another mechanism for proof of ID is the use of a set of personalised questions
which can serve to reinforce method 1. For instance questions regarding the users
personal past the answers for which are stored.

3. Another, more subtle mechanism, is the use of specific network and device
ifnormation relating to the user- this can be used to ensure the user is logging
from their habitual or authorised host, as opposed to unauthorised or unfamiliar
access points.


THe issue with these Confidentiality methods is that they may cause some issues
with ensuring Availability due to human failures (such as forgetting a password).
Thus organisations often deploye a self-service mechanisms for resetting passwords
or special personalised information.
In order to get past the further problem of ensuring the security of the resetting
process a set of further validating information is dpeloyed. For instance,the use
of a physical or memorised pin number (personal identification number).

Authentication processes can take on various approaches. They can be based on:
- Something you know  eg:  password, PIN, login questions
-Something you are: eye scan biometric, location
-Something you have: keycard, usb token
-Something you do: gestures/pattern


SOMETHING YOU KNOW
Basic Password strengthening - long multicharacter 8 plus chars.
- verify user's identity before allowing setting and resetting of a password

-change defaults (this can be forced by setting an initial use policy for the user
enforcing a change of password upon initial use)
- using an overly complex password is ironically insecure because it leads to a
tendency to write down the password and then this can be lost relatively easily.

ALongside such preventative measures, there can be further measures taken that
ensure maintaining authentication security:
- lockout policy if too many failed attempts
-regul changes perhaps every 45 days or 2 months.
-no sharing (although human failure is to be expected)
-no reuse (this can be avoided by using a password history database tool-
this can be set to rememebr a certain cycle of a number of passwords)
-deploying a previous login information (including geolocation) notification

SOMETHING YOU HAVE

This can include smart cards (id keycards) which have an rfid microchip or NFC
microchip. Usually these would be encrypted in an embedded manner with an
embedded certificate that holds a private key issued to the user and tied to the
card. This is then matched to a shared public key.  A card can also have a range
of further means of authentication beyond the simply cryptographic and radio
communication means. For instance, it may hold personally identifiable Information
such as a picture of the holder thus allowing for physical identification. Or it
may also hold biometric data that can be matched with the user's facial features.

A simpler version of the id keycard is the USB or token key. This is used in sync
with a server that holds a particule PIN that is used every 30 seconds or 60 seconds
the pin is then recycled into another pin. The holder of the token has the correct
pin when they turn on their token item but this only lasts 1 minute, allowing them
to use the pin for a two factor authentication but reducing the chances of someone
being able to access the pin.

HMAC One Time Paasword (HOTP) is an algorithm providing a randomised pin. Used in
conjunction with a password.
Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) is also a similar process although in this case
the pin/password created expires within 30 or 60secs of its formation.

SOMETHING YOU ARE

-Biometrics: prints, eyballs etc.
-One issue with biometrics is that they can have significant error rates. This can
include false acceptances/verifications or false rejections. The first is more
problematic than the second since the first can be a potential security breach while
the second can be a nuissance.

SOMEWHERE YOU ARE

-This can be done on the itnernet using IP addressing, although evidently there
can be failures due to IP spoofing.
-On an intranet, the same can be done using a MAC address (although again there is
a, albeit lesser, threat of MAC spoofing.)

SOMETHING YOU DO

-Weak overall.

+++ Note that a combiantion of any of these TYPES of authentications is considered
multifactor authentication.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
AUTHENTICATION SERVICES

Several authentication services are available. These include:

KERBEROS
-The widely used Kerberos service deployed using Docker or other deployment
environments.
    This was developped by MIT under the concept of creating a mutually authenticating
    environment:
        Achieved via a Key Distribution Centre which deploys a complex process to
        grant tickets that grant further tickets (TGTs) .The server (KDC) packages
        encrypted user credentials within a ticket. These tickets provide authentication
        for users as they interact with the centrally issued tickets.

        Kerberos also introduced a time element after version 5. This requires all
        hosts interacting with the central server to be synchronized within 5 minutes
        of the server's time. This is done to avoid a so-called replay attack in which a
        third-party may impersonate a previously issued ticket (for example by compromising
        one of the host machines). Using a time-element limits the chances of repeating
        access to the central server with its secured files and directories by changing
        the tickets every day, every few hours, or every week.

        Another tool to limit abuses of ticket use can be ensured by building a database
        of hosts interacting correctly with the kerberos KDC server.
LDAP
- Another authentication mechanism is the LDAP and Secure LDAP option:
    - LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
        - Basically a compartmentalised directory to allow access to a URI from
        authenticated users.
        - THe basic LDAP is not encrypted and instead works by assigning a Specific
        address to a user withing a specified domain (which can be internal intranet)
        - SLDAP (Secure LDAP) does encrypt. It uses TLS to the session before data
        transmission.
        -SLDAP v2 uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption but SDLAP v3 reverts to
        TLS encryption.

-Yet another option, and a much more popular one, is the SSO (Single Sign-On session)

SSO
SSO can be used in combination with other practices or methods in order to increase the
confidentiality (c) or accessibility (s):

One of these methods is the use of federation on wide area networks and especially interacting
networks such as two alternating but linked infrastructure. This basically ensures that the SSO login is done
from within a group of assigned federated identities that cna then be recognised as a "whole" by the
other network instution.

Another method is SAML (Secure Assertion Markup Language) which is derivative from XML
markup language a cousing of HTML. This markup language allows for protocol that ensures
the single sign-on process is ensured so long as the user stays within the portal pages
which are marked up with SAML. This is done by verifying the identity of the :
1. Principal (the user)
2. Identity provider - protocol
3. Service provider - backend server

VPN/ Remote Access Service (RAS)

At the core, this is a virtual dial up to a remote server which will "tunnel" the
connection through the server. The authentication of the VPN connection can be done via:

1. Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)- NOTE This is problematic because it sends the
passwords in plaintext (unencrypted). Deprecated tech used in dial up in the old days.

2.Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
  Essentially uses a secret information to challenge the user connect to a server- the
  server has the challenge answer. But in this case, unlike the PAP password, the
  challenge answer is communicated by the host to the server via  a hash which is based on
  a nonce (number used once) sent to host by server upon communcation.

3. Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP)
   Same as ChAP but the MS implementation= also quite Deprecated.

4. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
  Essentially this is a centralised server that interacts with a range of "sub" servers
  nthat provide initial authentication for the hosts. The hosts first authenticate with
  the sub-servers and then this authen request is passed on to the central server which
  holds the central database (or is coonnected to further servers) with the list of
  authenticated users.
5. DIAMETER
  This is simply an extension of RADIUS which implmenents Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
6. XTACACS (Extended TACACS)
  This is the Cisco proprietary  authentication protocol.
7. Terminal Access Controller  Access-Control System + (TACACS+)
  This is the Cisco alternative to the Radius/Diameter service.
  It has two benefits: unlike radius it encrypts the entire authentication processes
  (whereas radius only encrypts the password)
  Second TACACS+ uses multiple secret challenges when authenticating.
  TACACS+ can interact with Kerberos and Microsoft Active Directory, despite being
  a proprietary Cisco service. This allows for interaction with large scale networks.
  One potential use of TACACS+ is to authenticate the hosts seeking to connect to a
  network ahead of connection to the LAN via router or switch. The TACACS+ service
  can present the host with a configuration page in which they need to authetnticate
  their identity before thereafter connecting to the LAN.

Risk Reduction Control Methods:
-Risk Assessments:
  -Qualify and Quantify Risks in organization
  - Risk and impact assessments with both monetary as well as technical impacts.
-Vulnerability Assessments:
  -Check for current network weaknesses and vulns. Similar to bug bounties in
  software development.
  -security audits can check for any vulns/comprised systems.
  -log checking by a network security member of staff can check if the systems
  have been compromised or entered without authorisation. It can also check for
  attempts to access info from within without authorization.this is more a
detective measure.
  - network and systems monitoring - especially trend analysis of the type provided
  by Intruder Detection Systems (IDS') can act as a more preventative measure.
- PenTesting:
  A kind of active attack on a network to check for vulns. There can a varying range
  of level of attack- include a full scale red-team excercise.

-Operational (staff) Level:
  -Awareness and Training of the staff and protocols. Reducing risks of data or
  authentication information loss. (clean desk policy- use of physical security
  measures)
     -awareness of social engineering tricks. Awareness of need to patch and update.
     maintaining confidentiality especially of authentication. good security practices

  -hardware/software config management - basically can "harden" the OS, Software or
  physical limits on hardware access/modification.
    -Reducing functionality and disabling unecessary services of the OS, software
    and hardware in order to ensure security physical means to protect passwords
    and other authentication. Forcing users to change their passwords every 60 or
    90 days etc...
  - media protection - limiting access and use of media (hard disk, usb etc)
  -contingencies - planning for worst case scenarios, system outages, breach protocols
    -backups of data, redundancy of servers, system recovery procedure.
  -physical and environmental = cameras, locks, security guards, heating/cooling, shutdown
   ventilation.
      - Security guards can deter many attacks - especially the social engineering ones
      (except the best ones) because they can lock down the premises physically.
      -cable locks can be implemented on hardware- ensuring that interfering with hosts
      is a difficult and time-costly effort.
      -use of cameras can be both detective and preventative since it can be used to identify
      breaches, insider threats etc. motiondetectors and even heat signature detection in
      most paranoid cases..
      -doors can be locked using a range of potential security measures- from the simplest
      ones that could use a simply keylock to the more complex to crack biometric locks.
      -secure rooms/areas/perimeters
      -server and network rooms secured or even entirely apart in a separate compound
      -general perimeters with potentially high level guarding (dogs, traps, electric fence, patrols)
      -

////////////****FROM THE IP SPECIALISTS BOOK***********\\\\\\


Lesser known vulns that stand out :
- Weak cypher suites (deprecated encryption algos)
-Buffer vulns (memory or buffer overflow (also known as buffer overrun- caused by code error or
excess mem use in the buffer, can crash system or provide entrance for hacker),
buffer injection, memleak (when mem is opened up by
software but is not closed thereafter, allowing for crashing the system based on
using up all available mem on the machine via this loophole)
- DLL injection (Dynamic Link Library , used in Windows systems) injects libraries via a
program (either airdropped program or exploiting code vulns) - creates an entry point for
mal_actors
-pointer de-reference = mal_actors can exploit code to derefer a particular memory allocation
in an os or program in order to crash it or cause denial of service.


PREVENTION METHODS:

- Firewalls
    - Can be stateless or statefull:
          - Stateless doesn't have smart capacities and is more brunt. It simply blocks or allows
            certain addresses or ports.it is static.
          -The statefull firewall instead blocks but also learns to recognise certain ip addresses or ports
          under the current "state" or "session" it will deploy a "basket" of session ids that are to be
          accepted and allowed. It is therefore dynamic.

    -modern firewalls deploy several further instruments to pick out behavioral patterns of attackers:
        -This includes the deep-packet inspection software, or application layer gateways which inspect
        traffic application by application.
        -Access control lists can be generated from the firewall's activities via an access control list.
        -logical path queries can get the firewall to undertake a checklist from one higher priority to a
        lower priority or via other logics of inspection.
            - Rules can be given to the firewall to tell it to either:
                -specific or general rules based on the applciation , port or concept.
                -implicit deny rules : if the firewall goes through these pre-written rules and still finds apps
                or ports open then it can be told to automatically "clean up" or shut any remaining apps/ports.
            - A DMZ can be deployed to place connections to unknown or untrusted entities which can include
            certain ports that are more insecure. one benefit off the DMZ is that it slows down and complicates
            their attempts to map out the network and its devices because they will stuck for a while in the DMZ.
            -Deep packet inspection can be deployed. This can include traffic inspection on certain ports
            and even limiting access to all TCP-UDP connections inbound and outbound as a kind of "throttle" on traffic
            which can limit the potential for DoS attack.
            -At the end-user level, the hosts can deploy antivirus software which acts as an IPS/IDS (intrusion prevention
            and detection system).

NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION AND prevention
    -NIDS
        -filters IP addresses
        -can force a TCP connection to close immediately by forging a FIN packet
        -sends entries to a log file
        -launches a separate program to handle events

        Unlike NIDS NIPS will have both detection and prevention embedded. It is therefore more useful
        in "frontline" deployments on end-user hosts. NIDS, on the other hand, focusses on detection and
        logging. This means it is best deployed in a central server that gives the network admin a "bird's eye
        view of the events and connections inccluding malicious ones. some further deployment differences:

          -THe NIDS will be deployed only in the central server location and will only recieve reports of
          each packet as a copy of them. In contrast NIPS will be deployed on the network connections downstream
          from each server and host.
          -Thus, the NIPS has an in/line or "wiretapping" approach to inspection whilst the NIDS has a
          Promiscuous one (presumably meaning it takes in reports/packet copies from all directions)
          -Because the NIPS taps the line, it can cause delays and can even cause a point of failure due to
          its inspection of the incoming packets. It can make a mistake or be delayed by malicious traffic
          and thereby create a logjam, In contrast, the IDS only recieves copies and therefer cannot cause delays
          and it cannot be considered a point of failure.
          -The NIPS can immediately stop traffic and drop packets if it recognises an attack (in real time). In
          contrast the NIDS cannot immediately put an end to an attack but it can "learn" and analyze the packets
          and reports and thereby instruct NIPS to avoid any future malicious packets.
          -NIPS can perform packet manipulation and redirect traffic (for example to DMZ) but NIPS cannot manipulate
          since it only has copies of packets.


    -NIPS can use four approaches:
        -Patterns,
        -Stateful ,
        -Protocol,
        -Statistical/heuristic
        -traffic anomaly


ROUTERS AND SWITCHES

Certain standard techniques can help secure routers:

  - disabling unused rourter interfaces (i.e. UPnP)
  -Disable unused services such as CDP, FTP
  - disable management protocols that are not being used: telnet, SMTP
  -Disable redirecting techniques like ICMP redirects and IP Source routing
  - Disable tools that can be exploited for probing and wifi scanning  like Finger, ICMP unreachables
  and ICMP mask reply.
  - Ensure deployment of secure measures such as IP identification and TCP KeepAlive messages
  -disable gratuitous ARP and proxy ARP
  -disable IP-directed broadcasts
  -Enable SSH for access to the router
  -Enable Unicast RPF on outside interfaces
  -set users
  -enable logging
  -set enable secret password (admin password)
  -disable IP source route
  -enable password encryption service
  -use secure protocols

  For Switches:

  - change default passwords
  -enable logging
  -use secure protocols
  -configure AAA
  -configure management VLAN
  - network segmentation
  -Enable SSH
  -configure management IP addresses
  -configure port security


Proxies can be deployed to act as a URL filterer, for extra
layer of security:
-explicit proxy will need to be configured on each user host
-transparent proxy -  doesn't require configuration, on the user host since
it works in the background.

  Proxy types:
  -Application proxies: NEtwork Address Translator- Work with one or more applications to proxy that app's traffic
  -forward proxy - inside the network and can help users more securely navigate the internet from within their host machine
  using the URL filters.
  - reverse proxy - controls what traffic comes from the other side of the network connection- filters URLs as they arrive
  toward the host.
  - open proxy  : third party proxy, not controlled by the owner or host. Can pose a security issue since you have to trust them-
  it is most commonly used to proxy the existing security controls, blocklists or even to circumvent the company proxies themselves.


Load Balancing :  basically distribubtes traffic between servers - allows for network data balancing, avoids single point of failure,
mitigates DDOS attacks.
      Scheduling is done from the central "load balancer" server using the following methods:
          - Affinity: basically "whitelists" some users, hosts, ips in order to create a certain "fast track" or multitracks of traffic
          between the sub-servers and hosts.
          -Round Robin: Cycle or rotation between servers- equally distributing traffic from one sub-server to another based on whichever
          algos are deployed. More complex algos will take into account the data load on each server
          - Active-Passive  : active-passive load balances- two load balancers, one actively balancing, the other is monitoring the data
          and takes over if ative balancer is overwhelmed.
          -Active active - two balancers, both sharing balancing duties- avoids single point of failure.
          -Virtual IP - The load balancer server does not actually need to be assigned a physical IP. It can reflect the IPs of each of the
          sub-servers and adopt them whenever it is in connection with them and external traffic via a virtual IP.
Access POints
    -SSID  -identified - disabling or hidng doesnt actually hide it.
    -MAC filters - filtering based on physical address. Easy to spoof and circumvent.
    -Signal strength - reduces power of the signal, useful for proximity attacks.
    -Bands - 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz : doesn't make much different. 5Ghz is less strong and distant.
    -Antennas = Omnidirectional or directional (focused beam) Yagi antenna also can find long distance speccific focus beam between 1 to even 5 miles.
    -Fat vs. Thin thick are more smart, recognising and adapting to connections. Thin are less smart.
    -Controlled vs standalone  - thick or fat access point is standalone. Includes encryptoin, authentication and channel/degree managemend.
    The controlled one has all the above but also provides load balancing and easy patching .
    -WAP
        - SIEM (security information and event management)
                Examples of such software includes:
                -ArcSight express
                -McAfee ESM
                -IBM Security QRadar
                -Splunk Enterprise
                -LogRythm
            -Logging: This software allows more in-depth logging.
                  - provides a centralized database that brigns data from all acccess points and hosts to a single device.
                  - provides monitoring and security alerts.
                  -stores logs
                  -provides some statistical or heuristic analysis allowing for data correlation.
              -challenges
                  - one challenge with synchronizing all of these servers, hosts and network points is the need for time synchronization between
                  devices.  This can be done using a "NTP" Network Time Protocol. NOTE detecting synchronization is actually telling hackers That
                  servers are load balanced.
              -transfer
                  -SIEM software allows for transferring logs. Particular sensitive organizations will use single use recording hardware; for instance
                  instead of deploying a USB, it will deployed a DVD-R.
            -DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
                -USB blocking  = can block removable mass storage (USB-Universal Serial Bus) in order to avoid worms/trojans .
                -Cloud-based DLP   - can avoid data loss by uploading and downloading with servers. Howver, can be insecure.
                -Email DLP = monitoring email ingoing outgoing based on ips and even content analysis (especially on attachements)
    -NAC (Network Access Controls)
         - Dissolvable = deployed upon demand and then removed as hoc
         -Permanent = Permanent Network access controls allow for more fixed blocks and are pre-deployed to endpoing users (hosts)
         -health check = check the host before providing access to the network- for isntance deploying an antivirus scan ahead of authenticating network access
         -Agent status = Agent-based NAC means a host has access to the network via an authentication process that is stored on the host and runs when the host
         connects to the network . Agentless network access works with a central server that identifies user-per-user basis authentication on a host and thereby
         grants network access. Checks are performed parallel to the user login into the host machine and when they log off the access is cut off- it is not
         permanently locally stored on the host and cannot be scheduled (for instance, providing a certain time-period for network authentication password to be
         valid) - an example of this is through Windows Active Directory .
    -Mail
        -Gateways
            -Spam detection  based on IPs and the following :
            -whitelist - trusted users, locations, ip /
            -SMTP standards -blocks anything that doesn't follow RFC standards .
            -Reverse DNS - rDNS -checks domain name from which the emergent mail is coming.
            -Tarpitting = slows down the connection to specific habitual offenders in order to dissuade .
            - Recipient filtering - blocks emails that are not from a valid recipient (eg within organization or specific domains)
    -Bridges = Network segregation device- working at OSI Layer 2 (data layer)
        -SSL/TLS = SSL accelerator can help when there is a wide area network including hundreds of servers. It can ensure that data encryption is done efficiently
        accross all of the sub-networks.
        -SSL decryption = decrypts the data reaching a site from a browser, inspects the data and then re-encrypts it in transit.
    -Media Gatway = connects from PSTN then converts to VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) to be used with internal company VOIP lines. (secure phoning in)
    -Hardware Security = A secure module that stores crypto keys and security backups for a range of servers and internal certificates (ensures physical security behind net sec)

  - captures packets
  -solves application issues (connecting)
  - allows to see traffic patterns

-Network Scanner - (Nmap, also Netcat)
  -detects which services are running
  -notes the OS
  -notes non usual (rogue) hosts
  -visuals of the networks

-vuln scanner (notes network vulns as updated)
-config scanner  (notes correct configs on the host/server)
-data sanitization (overwrites etc )

-passive tools (work passively in background- for example TripWire which notifies admin of changes to hashes on files)
-wireless scanners (like aircrack-ng)

CMD sec tools:
- pinging tool
-netstat  -a all connections -b show  binaries - n don't resolve names
-traceroute  -determines packet route In windows CMD it is: tracert
-IPconfig (linux) - Ifconfig (windows)

ARP -A show all arp table conns.

tcp dump = dump packets on cmd (to vi)


IDS/IPS are usually packaged in endpoint sec via antivirus/firealls on hosts.
Can work in four domains:
-File System Monitoring - hashing checks, examining file changes
-Log Files analysis - generating warnings for net and sys admins about unexpected events
-Connection Analysis - checking networks, open ports, devices connected on the (W)LAN.
-Kernel level- analysing any changes in kernel binaries as a result of rootkit attacks


Secure protocols
-SRTP = Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (Secure RTP)
    -VOIP but with AES encryption
    -Uses HMAC-SHA1 meaning that authentication integrity is verify and protection deployed
    against replay attacks.
    -Thus avoids a MiTM attack.


NETWORK BEST PRACTICES/ARCHITECTURE:

Questions about OS being deployed, Defense in Depth or layered security, diversity of vendors
and control mechanisms, to avoid being overwhelmed by a single point of failure in terms of one
brand failing or being penetrated.
Admin policies and access controls/procedurs and technical controls.
Training.

Deploying a DMZ is one technique to create a kind of grey zpone in which malicious traffic can be
guided toward and dealt with/recognised.
    -A private version of the DMZ can be created, otherwise known as an extranet.

An intranet is, evidently, an internal network for authenticated hosts only- sometimes coonnected
to using a VPN.

An Ad-Hoc network is a much less secure system which allows easy network between devices, without
an intermediary access point.

A honey net is a type of DMZ that is specifically intended for attracting and capturing malicious
actors- it is a vitrualised network (fake network).

Netwrok Address Translation (NAT) is basically the system of IPv4 or IPv6 network addressing on an IP
level.

VPNs allow for encrypted comms between hosts and networks, or between hosts directly via host to host
on-device encryption.

Sensors and collectors collect information at critical parts of the network to monitor trafic,
connections, the state of physical devices and whetehr they are on or off.


Proxy servers allow a filtering of IPs and websites - for worker safety. Some workers may decide
to deploy non-internal third party proxies to circumvent these blocks- which can cause potential
infection risks.

SSL/ TLS etc - encryption protocols.

Load Balancers mitigated DDoS risks and balance out network loads.

DDoS mitigator can be deployed can filter high data flows to avoid denial of service.

A Test Access Point (TAP) and Port Mirror can be dpeloyed at key network nodes to make copies of
activity on one or multiple ports as a means of making analytical copies of traffic for future understan
A SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer) allows for copying of port traffic also, as with TAP, but there are some
differences:
TAP                                             SPAN
Test Access POint                             Switch Port Analyzer
Can't monitor intra-switch traffic            can't handle full duplex links without dropping packets
costly                                        low cost
Doesn't drop packets                          remotely configurable from any system connected
Full visibility of the networks               filters out physical layer errors


HOST SECURITY

-FDE (Full Disk Encryption) -
-TPM (Trusted Platform Module)-on the hardware level - becomes a trust point of storage for all encryption keys
-HSM (Hardware Security Module) - usually an external key like USB which provides a place for backing up
the main cryptographic keys of the server/host. It usually also has its own inbuilt tamper protection mechanism,
to avoid attempts at accessing the backups stored on the USB.
